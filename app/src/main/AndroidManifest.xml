### Explanation of Scenario-Based Components and Permissions:

- **MainActivity**: This component serves as the main user interface of the application. When the user launches the app, they are presented with a dashboard where they can manage their social media accounts and automate posting. This is a key part of the user workflow for configuring their social media management strategies.

- **AutomationService**: This service runs continuously in the background, ensuring that posts are scheduled and executed even when the app is not actively open. In practical applications, this allows users to maintain a regular posting schedule without manual intervention, thereby enhancing productivity.

- **Permissions**:
  - **INTERNET Permission**: Essential for connecting to social media platforms to fetch content and post updates.
  - **WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE and READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE**: Necessary for managing media files that are either uploaded to social media platforms or downloaded from them, ensuring a seamless user experience for content sharing.

This configuration is designed to support a full-fledged social media management tool that leverages MadHub's capabilities for automated operations, supporting 24/7 functionality, and creating a user-friendly interface for effective social media management.
